# Statson's Privacy Policy

## Terminology Breakdown
The definitions below are to avoid misinterpretations and offer clearer insight to the reader. These definitions are valid throughout this document.
> It should be noted that the following terminology is NOT case sensative!

- **Bot**: Refers to the software application and/or bot account (Statson) governed by this privacy policy.
- **Server/Guild**: Refers to any Discord server or guild in which the Bot has been or is currently active.
- **You/Your**: Denotes the individual owning the user account that engages with the Bot.
- **Information**: All the details that the Bot gathers from the data You share/input on Discord.
- **User**: Refers to another person using the Bot that is not you.

## Why We Gather Information
To ensure that the Bot delivers its functions as intended, certain Information detailed in the subsequent section is gathered and stored. You retain the right to request the removal of some of the Information the Bot accumulates about you. To do so, please contact [myself](https://discordapp.com/users/671610612475756576) on Discord. Upon your request, I will inform you about what specific data can be deleted.

## **What Data do we collect, and when?**
All Data the Bot collects is listed below in categories of usage.

- #### **Through Commands/Components**
    The following items may be collected when intentionally provided by You and/or a User through running one of the Bot's commands.

    - Your account's ID.
    - Your timezone ([Refer to Timezone Policy](https://github.com/Benzo-Fury/Statson-Documents/blob/main/sub-documents/timezone-policy.md))
    - Notes and infractions recorded by moderators related to your behavior within the server. It's important to note that once these infractions are documented, they are permanent and cannot be deleted or removed.


- #### **Automatically**
    Statson does not proactively gather personal data, with the exception of temporarily storing information in its cache.

    - Public Discord Data temporarily stored in a cache:
        - Messages.
        - Users.

Persistent Information is housed unencrypted in a password-protected database. Transient Information remains in the Bot's cache during its uptime. While every effort is made to ensure the safety of stored data, complete security cannot be unconditionally assured.

## Feedback Provisions
Any feedback, be it remarks, suggestions, error reports, or otherwise, shared by You, may be adapted or utilized as seen fit by us.

## Consent & Acceptance
Interacting with the Bot or simply being a part of a Server with the Bot implies Your endorsement of and compliance with this privacy policy. Should You dissent from any provision herein, you may either remove the Bot from your Server (if you manage one) or exit the Server where the Bot operates.
