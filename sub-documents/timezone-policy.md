# Statson Timezone Policy

## Introduction:
Statson provides a feature that allows users to share their timezone information with others in the server. This Timezone Policy outlines the specifics of how this feature works, what information is collected, and how it can be accessed or deleted.

## Setting Your Timezone:

- Creation: By using the `/time create` command followed by a specific timezone, you are choosing to share this piece of information with other members of the server. This action implies that you're aware of and consent to this data being publicly accessible.
- Visibility: Once set, your timezone becomes a piece of information that other members can view. This information does not reveal your exact location, but it does give an indication of your general geographical region based on the timezone.
## Accessing Timezone Information:

- Query: Any member of the server can use the `/time get` command to see the timezone information of another user who has set it. This is a public feature, and by setting your timezone, you acknowledge that others can access this information.
- Purpose: The primary intent of this feature is to facilitate better communication and understanding among server members, especially if they are spread across various time zones.
## Removing Your Timezone:

- Deletion: If at any point you decide that you no longer wish to share your timezone information, you can remove it using the `/time delete` command. Once deleted, other members will no longer be able to access your timezone using the /time get command.
- Data Retention: Upon deletion, your timezone data is removed immediately. Statson does not retain this data once the deletion command has been executed.
## Consent:
By utilizing the timezone feature, you acknowledge and agree to the terms laid out in this Timezone Policy. If you do not wish for your timezone information to be publicly accessible, refrain from using the `/time create` command or promptly delete your timezone data using the `/time delete` command.
