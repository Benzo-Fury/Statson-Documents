Rest assured, this information is strictly for internal use and will only be shared with myself or other SWOC Members.

## Termination
Both I and a Moderator reserve the right to Exclude or restrict access to You at any time, without prior notice or reason. Such Exclusions may be permanent or temporary, at our sole discretion.

## Dispute Resolution
All grievances or disputes related to the Bot or these Terms of Service will be addressed solely by Me. All decisions I make in response to such disputes are final and binding.

## Modification of Terms
These Terms of Service may be updated or changed at any time without prior notice. It is Your responsibility to periodically review these terms to ensure you are aware of any changes. Continued use of the Bot after any changes signifies your acceptance of the revised terms. I am under no obligation to notify You of any changes.

## Feedback Provisions
Any feedback, be it remarks, suggestions, error reports, or otherwise, shared by You, may be adapted or utilized as seen fit by Me.
